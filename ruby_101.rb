***DISCLAIMER:::

Its important to note that this tutorial was designed to be used in conjunction with the above
lynda.com/Ruby-tutorials video training series, the online ruby API per your ruby version (I crawled the above sites so I didnt need to depend on an active www connection), and irb to really
learn the language fundamentals. You wont learn ruby by watching videos, or simply watching the videos and following along with this script, no, you have to write your own code and
especially do NOT copy and paste. 

Before moving on to the next lesson, make sure you 100% understand the material, and know how/why it outputs what is shown here!!! Otherwise you have already failed yourself.

ALSO atvvk is an acronym for the 5 learning styles::

>> atvvk.shuffle
=> ["verbal", "visual", "tactile", "kinesthetic", "aural"] <- Keep that in mind when learning a new alien language

     'x02 OBJECT TYPES'  
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#----------------------------
     '#1 OBJECTS'  
#----------------------------

# Ruby is an object oriented programming language. Everything in ruby is an object, except for variables. All of the following ruby object types are related because they are all objects. Many other programming languages have primitives. Primitives are like ruby objects, but they dont have a common relationship like ruby object types do. An object is the fundamental building block in ruby. Everything you manipulate is an object, and everything that is returned by your manipulation is an object. All objects are instances of a class. In the terms of students and classrooms, each unique student is an example of the classification student. In programming we would say that each student is an object or an instance of the class student. They're all unique, but they also all have something in common as well. 
     
#----------------------------
     '#2 VARIABLES'  
#----------------------------
     
# Variables are not objects. We can use them to keep track of our objects, and to give us an easy way to talk about, and reference our objects while programming. Variables need to have a value assigned to them before you can start using them because they are all undefined by default. 
     
     # Example: Assign a value to variable 'atvvk'
     
     atvvk  = ["aural", "tactile", "verbal", "visual", "kinesthetic"]
     => ["aural", "tactile", "verbal", "visual", "kinesthetic"]
     atvvk.shuffle
     => ["kinesthetic", "verbal", "aural", "tactile", "visual"]
     
     # atvvk is a variable that is pointing to an object (the array is an object, and the return value is even an object). Let me reiterate again by saying that everything in ruby is an object, except for variables, which allow us to point to our objects. Many different programming languages have naming conventions for variables like $char for example (variable has to start with the '$' sign). In ruby thats not true. All we have to do is have an all lower case / underscored name ('var_kill = xyz'). 
     
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     '#2.2 VARIABLES | VARIABLE SCOPE INDICATORS'  
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# In addition to just having a lowercase_inderscored word be the name of our variable name. We can also put some additional characters in front of it that will let ruby know what the scope of the variable is, and where it should be available. Scope determines whether or not we have access to variables form inside classes, methods, and other coding structures. So far in this tutorial, we have only covered local variables (nothing in front of it). 
     
Define the following Ruby Variable Scope Indicators:
'$variable'    global variable
'@@variable'   class variable
'@variable'    instance variable
'variable'     local variable
'variable'     block variable

# Example: details coming soon!

     '#3 INTEGERS'  
#----------------------------
 
# Interers are simply numbers. In ruby, numbers are divided into two major categories or subclasses of the interger class.  The only difference is the way ruby stores these values in memory. Characters are stored as numbers in RAM. Every letter & symbol has an ASCII value. 
     
     # Bignum: consumes more ram to store bigger numbers, & reserve more space.
     
     # To keep it from taking up to much space all the time, fixnum is used for smaller numbers.
     
     # Fixnum: more efficient for smaller numbers, and ruby switches back and forth automatically as needed.
     
     #1 Integers
     #2 Floating-point numbers (precision-floats) // known outside of programming as decimal numbers

     '#4 FLOATS'  
#---------------------------- 
     
     # known outside of programming as::
       Floating-point numbers (floats)
       - Decimal numbers
       - Numbers with precision

     '#5 STRINGS'  
#----------------------------

# Strings are a sequence of characters that are strung together. 
                # They can be a letter, word, sentence, paragraph, or even several paragraphs
     
'strings'        Collection of textual characters including digits, letters, whitespace, & symbols of any length. All are objects of Rubys string class. puts "Die!".class << String

'string literal' Embedded directly into code/program using quotation marks. This differs from a 'string' whose data comes from a remote surce, typing in text, a file, or internet.

                # Examples:
                 >> "hello"
                 => "hello"
                 >> 'hello'
                 => "hello"
                 >> greeting = 'hello'
                 => "hello"
                 >> target = 'world'
                 => "world"   
                 >> greeting + ' ' + target         # Display helloworld with a space in between 
                 => "hello world"
	         >> "learn"*10                      # Multiply string by 10 and output
                 => "learnlearnlearnlearnlearnlearnlearnlearnlearnlearn"

     '#8 HASHES'  
#----------------------------

# An unordered, object-indexed collection of objects or (key-value pairs). You cant depend on the order in which values are stored in hashes. Also, instead of being indexed by position, and keeping track of the number like done for arrays, hashes are kept track of by using an object or key-value pair. They have one object thats the label(key), and it references a second object thats the contents(value). Hashes are not in order, so they can be rearranged. A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs. It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index. The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary, and will generally not be in the insertion order.

# Hashes have a default value that is returned when accessing keys that do not exist in the hash. By default, that value is nil.

=begin

               Example:

               Arrays(preserve order) keeps track of values by indexing the position & assigning a number slot. 
               When to use an array:
               When you want to preserve the order, and the the position matters.
                 
               Hashes(Labeled) have an assigned label(key), and its contents(value). 
               When to use an hash:
               When the order does not matter, and you want the convinience of having that label to be able to refer to values as labels instead of having to remember what was in index position # 7? This is not needed, as a hash can used. Other programming languages might refer to them as dictionaries.

     '#9 SYMBOLS'  
#----------------------------
     
 # Symbols are going to seem alot like strings and variables, but they are not. A symbol is a label used to identify a piece of data. A string can also be used as a label as used by hashes. So why do we need symbols?
     
 # Symbols are better because they are stored in memory one time vs strings that are stored each time. So, in order to reduce the memory footprint of our ruby programs, we need to use symbols.
     
     >> :this_test
     => :this_test
     >> :this_test.class
     => Symbol                             # Im just checking the symbol class here, nothing important
     
     # String test vs symbol test  // important!
     >> "test".object_id                   
     => 10952840                           # test1: The object_id of the string "test"
     >> :test.object_id                    
     => 146888                             # test2: Symbol" object_id is different than the "string" object_id
     >> "test".object_id
     => 10823180                           # test3: The object_id of the string "test" is different each time!!
     >> :test.object_id
     => 146888                             # Remains the same because it re-uses the same symbol already stored
                                           # in memory each time the :test label is called!!
     
     # The reason for the three different object_id's is because ruby created a new string called "test" for test3:, and in doing so it created a new object with a new object_id. So it didnt re-use the first object we created via test1: with object_id of "10952840" as shown above. This is important, make sure you understand what is going on here before moving forward. Doing this a couple times in irb might help clarify.
     
     # For that reason, symbols work really well inside hashes.
     >> hash = {:first_name => 'Rick', :last_name => 'Flores'}
     => {:first_name=>"Rick", :last_name=>"Flores"}

     => "Rick"
     
     # Symbols are not variables
     >> :test = 1

     hash[:first_name]                                       # Hash is the variable, with the first_name label
     
     # Bottomline
     # If what were talking about really is a word, the sequence of characters is important, or if its going to be for output, then well use a string. But if its a label being used to identify a piece of data, or to pass a message around differnt parts of our ruby program, then we should use symbols.

     '#10 BOOLEANS'  
#----------------------------
    
# A boolean is like an on/off switch, and will have the value 1 or 0, or true or false. Booleans are typically used for doing comparisons. For example:
     
     if x  = 1, then output x
     if x != 1, then output y

         # Ruby Comparison operators:
">="     Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
"<"      Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
">"      Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
"<="     Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
"<=>"    Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second. 
"=="     # Called the "equal to" operator. It checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
"==="    Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.
".eql?"  True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.
"equal?" True if the receiver and argument have the same object id.

         # Ruby Logical operators:
"!"      Called Logical NOT Operator. Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then 
Logical NOT operator will make false. It also checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
"!="     Called Logical NOT equal operator. If x is not = to 1, 
"&&"     Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero then then condition becomes true.
"||"     Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero then then condition becomes true.
"or"     Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero then then condition becomes true.
"and"    Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are true then then condition becomes true.
"not"    Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.

     # You just say x when its 1, when its 2, when its 3, ...etc! We can also have the else statement at the end or we can leave it off if you want.
     
     # Other programming languages might call this technique switch!
     # If that is what you are use to, then we recommend you switch over and start using case instead.

=begin 
     
     TWO VERY IMPORTANT things to make note of, and MAKE SURE you understand.
     
     1. What we have done here is integrate the break if statement at the top, and made it part of the loop 
     structure itself. Thats what our boolean test at the top is, while x < 20
	
     2. In out two previous "Break" loop examples the loop stopped when output reached 18. 
     In our new example above it stops at 20. An important thing to notice about while loops is that
     it matters what the value of X is at the start of the loop. Before when we were doing our break, 
     it MATTERED what was happening INSIDE THE LOOP. We had the break after X incremented, 
     
              >>   loop do                 # start a loop
              ?>   x += 2                  # x will increment by 2
              >>   break if x >= 20        # break out of loop if x is greater than or = to 20
              >>   next if x == 6          # next, if x == 6
              >>   puts x                  # if its not then just output the value of x to the screen
              >>   end                     # terminate loop
     
     it went ahead and looped anyway 
     
     At our current while loop IT DOESNT START THE PROCESS IF THIS BOOLEAN IS TRUE => if "x < 20" is true!!!
     So its evaluating at the very TOP vs INSIDE THE LOOP like the break loop example.
    
     >> while x < 20      # While x is less than 20
     >>   x += 2          # X will increase/increment by 2
     >>   puts x          # Output x
     >>   end             # End the loop
    
    Make sure you understand what is going on here before moving on!!
     
     If we were to write a break loop with the loop being evaluated at the top like our current while loop, vs inside the loop like the original break loop, it would look  like this.
     
   x = 0
  loop do
     break if x >= 20  moved break from below x += 2, to above x += 2 so its first to get evaluated!!
     x += 2
     puts x
  end
 
  Be very careful of those two rules when using while loops, always test your code (;
 
 While and until also work the way if does, and we can use them inline.
  For example:
  
  x = 0
  puts x += 2 while x < 100          # Output x & increment by 2 while x is less than 100
  
  y = 3245
  puts y /= 2 until y <= 1            # Output y divided by equal 2 until y is less than or equal to 1
                                      # Divided by equal "/=" works the exact same way as += does
   So it will keep getting smaller, and smaller and keep putting out the results until y is less than or equal to 1, which is pretty much until the end (;

     end                    # Matter of fact, until is while something is not true.

     '#3 CONDITIONALS ITERATORS'  
#--------------------------------------

     #-------------------
     # - iterators 
     #-------------------
	      
=begin
The real power of Ruby is with the other looping structure called Iterators.
Iterators work alot like loops which we discused earlier. The only difference is that just looping waiting for something to happen, for us to take control and break out of it or to do
something else, instead with an interator were traversing a fixed set of data. We know where the starting point and ending point is. Were basically saying, for each one of these things, do
this process, do this loop, so were gonna do a code block once for each item in a set of data. 

Now we can also accomplish the above with loops, for example:

While Loop:
=end
x = 0
while x < 5     # while x is less than 5
puts "Hello"    # Output "Hello"
x += 1          # X increments by 1
end             # End the while loop
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
=> nil
>>
=begin
What the while loop does is basically output Hello 5 times!
If were trying to do that, we can more simply use the ruby syntax with an interator loop.

Iterator Loop:
=end
>>     5.times do
?>       puts "Hello"
>>     end
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
=> 5
>>
=begin
It might not be obvious how this is iterating, and how its iterating thru numbers, it might just look like its looping 5 times, but its not, and we will cover it soon. But first, lets check
out other common iterators that are similar:
=end
1.upto(5)   {puts "Hello"}    # 1 up to 5, puts hello
5.downto(1) {puts "Hello"}    # 5 down to 1, puts hello
(1..5).each {puts "Hello"}    # Range, 1 to 5, each put hello
=begin
Essentialy what each is dong is, take each item in this range, and do this code block

Also note the curly braces on the code blocks instead of the do and end loops that we are already used to.
This is just a shorthand syntax for it, so we will be using/seeing both, both styles are code blocks,
We will be talking about code blocks next, but for now, just make a note of this:

1. do end is a code block
2. curly braces {} are code blocks

Theres moe to an iterator than just making it easier and shorter to write. Theres an awesome feature where we have access to the values inside the dataset while were iterating thru it.

Example:
=end
>> 1.upto(5) do |i|           # |i| is just a local variable being used inside the loop to keep track of
                              # the elements in this dataset
?>     puts "Hello" + i.to_s  # Output hello + value of "i" to string to be presented to the screen  
>>   end                      # terminate loop
=begin
The first time thru i is equal to 1, second time its 2, and so on, it increments all the way up to 5, so it will go in and grab the value of "i" as it increments eachtime and output it to
the screen.

Detailed Breakdown:
=end
>> 1.upto(5) do |i|           # We set the local variable to keep track of datasets as "i"
puts "Hello" + i.to_s         # Code block where we have "i" available to us, "i" is the value of each element
                              # as it iterates thru the dataset. 
>>   end                      # terminate loop

Hello1
Hello2
Hello3
Hello4
Hello5
=> 1
>>    

=begin
Know lets use an example that doesnt use numbers:
=end
>> fruits = ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"]
=> ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"]
>> fruits.each do |fruit|  # As it iterates, itll pop a fruit into that value fruit 
?>     puts fruit.capitalize                  # Above line also went thru our loop and iterated thru each item
>>   end
Strawberries                                  # Output value for fruit does MATTER! 
Uvas                                          # Output value for fruit does MATTER!
Melon                                         # Output value for fruit does MATTER!
=> ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"]          # Return value for fruits does not matter
>>

=begin
If you want to write the same loop another way, you can use the "for" statement as seen below. This is not the same as the for statements in java, c++ etc.
=end
>> for fruit in fruits
>>   puts fruit.capitalize
>>   end
Strawberries
Uvas
Melon
=> ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"]         # Return value for fruits does not matter 

=begin
We still have access to the same control functions we used with our loops. These work with iterators as well.
=end
break = # terminate the whole loop
The most useful because we can use a conditional to say if x > 10 then break out of this loop, were done. Break functions as "QUIT IMMEDIATELY"

next  = # jump to the next loop
Useful because we can use it to immediately jmp to the next loop, start the loop over again.
But dont do anything thats below/after me. Next functions as "LOOP IMMEDIATELY"
=begin
Redo and Retry are more useful to us while using iterators because:

Now retry doesnt just say, start the loop over, retry says, go back to beginning of the set
["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"]
So it will do ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"], and do ["strawberries", "uvas", "melon"] again!!

Redo does is similar:
So redo will do ["strawberries", "melon"], and if we do a redo it will do the "melon" again!! We'll ofcourse need to have some branching conditional if statements to ensure were not just
endlessly looping on one thing.

Bottomline:

We can use redo and retry a little more effectively with iterators, than we could with loops
=end
redo  = # redo this loop
	      
retry = # start the whole loop over. This applies to more complex loops we will try later on

     #-------------------
     # - what is a code block?

     end              
     
# do end is what is used for multi lined code blocks, also works for 1000 lines of code as an example.

	# It says the variable num is undefined because its looking for a local variable, and num is a block variable.
	
# Block variables only exist inside the block, so we only have access to them inside the block, and thats
# what ruby means by variable scope!!! Because we have access to it inside the block, the block is its scope!
# We dont have access to it outside. Wht the previous example did, was it was using num in a temporary 
# sort of way and discarding it at the end because the block is done. No reason to store it after. 
	
# Thats variable scope in its simplest definition, but there also 3 VERY IMPORTANT points that we must also cover:	
	
	
     #-------------------
     # -  3 VERY IMPORTANT points about variable scope
     #-------------------

	
# 1. Even though we dont have access to our block variables in our local scope, we do have access to our local variables inside the blocks scope.
	
# To demonstrate this we simply call our local variable 'x' within the block variable
>> x = 1
=> 1
>> array.each {|num| puts num * 20 + x }    # call to our local variable 'x' within the block variable
21

81
101
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>
	

# 2. The second point is about different ruby versions outputting different results.

# Example:
>> puts num     # num is still undefined because weve only previously used it as a block variable.
NameError: undefined local variable or method num for main:Object
        from (irb):132
        from /usr/bin/irb:12:in <main>

# So lets define it.
>> num = 1                                    # Now its defined as a local variable
=> 1                                          # Output to confirm this action
>> array.each {|num| puts num * 20 + x }      # Lets try calling 
21
41
61
81
101
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> puts num
1
=> nil
>>

# Now that we have defined num as a local variable, and we perform a call to it, it should return 'num =1'
>> num
=> 1
>>

# if you get the number 5, what is happening is that old ruby versions bring in the local value of 'num = 1'
# for you to use inside the block, the same way that it brought in the local variable x above it brought in num.
# Even if we also declared it as a block variable, its as if we never had declared it as a block at all!!!! Its
# just making use of it the same way we made use of x. 

# If you receive a 1, as shown above, then that means your on a newer version of ruby, and it is outputting it 
# properly. It did not change the value, because num = 1. Starting at ruby version 1.9.1 it behaves differently.
# If we explicitly define it as a block variable, it prevents it from bringing into scope because it interprets
# it as "no I really mean, I want num to be a block variable!". The fact that weve defined it as a block variable, makes it only accessible as a block variable, 
 # and thats the true and honest way it should be.

# Ruby versions before 1.9.1 will have the old behavior. So BEWARE of the ruby version gobblins !!!!!!


# 3. The third point is that if you thought the first two points were confusing, 
# then you should really name your variables descriptive names to distinguish between local
# and block variables!!!!!


     #-------------------
     # - Common methods that use blocks
     #-------------------

find/detect
merge
collect
sort
inject

# The main thing that all of the above methods have in common is that theyre gonna take a code block. And that
# code block for everyone one of them is going to be a boolean expression. Code blocks dont have to be 
# necessarily made up of action statements like puts, or setting variables.


     #-------------------
     # -  FIND
     #-------------------

# Were going to learn how to use code blocks effectively with various ruby find methods to find data objects
# inside a dataset. There are 5 main find methods we will learn. 


# Simple example:
find/detect # find, with the synonym of detect
(1..10).find {|i| i == 5}  # inclusive range with the find method
                           # one line code block in curly braces declaring a block variable of 'i'
                           # Each number in the range will be put into 'i' as it iterates thru the set.
                           # Its not actually an iterator, but it works according to the same principals.
                           # Its gonna take each value and present it up to that block variable 'i'
                           # Boolean expression is i == 5
 (1..10).find {|i| i == 5}
=> 5
# It went thru the set and it stopped when the 'i' was equal to 5.

# More complex example:
>> (1..10).find {|i| i % 3 == 0 } 
=> 1                         
# Using the modulus % operator it divides i by 3, and returns the remainder
# If it divides evenly, the remainder is 0, what we are asking it is, what numbers are evenly divisible by 3?

>> (1..10).find {|i| i % 3 == 0}
=> 3
>>
# You see it returns the first value of what numbers are evenly divisible by 3. The imporatant thing 
# to note here is that it only returns the first one. Thats why find has the synonym for detect.

>> (1..10).detect {|i| i % 3 == 0}
=> 3
# This is the exact same thing, and says, look at the set, and detect the first one where this is true!!!

# Lets use detect again, but this time lets find out which numbers when multiplied by 3 are still 
# betwwen 1..10?

>> (1..10).detect {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 3) }  # If we * i * 3, is it still included in this set???
=> 1

# It reported 1, because 1 * 3 = 3 and its still in the set. It found the first case where that applied.
>> (1..10).detect {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 6) }
=> 1
>> (1..10).detect {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 9) }
=> 1
>> (1..10).detect {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 10) }

# Find/Detect will always return a single object, or it will return nil / (empty array), when it doesnt apply.

>> (1..10).detect {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 11) }
=> nil

# Now instead of finding the first instance where its true (i * 3), what if want to find all?

>> (1..10).find_all {|i| (1..10).include?(i * 3) }
=> [1, 2, 3]                           # Returns an array of all numbers divisable by 3 upto 10

>> (1..100).find_all {|i| (1..100).include?(i * 3) }
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]                        # Returns an array of all numbers

# Just because were using ranges, and arrays with very simple numbers to illustrate the point, doesnt mean
# you cant use more complex things. You can detect whether a string matches or not, whether a hash has a

     #-------------------
     # - MERGE  
     #-------------------

# Merge is another ruby method that makes good use of code blocks for merging hashes together. 
# Its only for hashes!!

>> h1 = { "a" => 111, "b" => 222 }

>> h2 = { "b" => 333, "c" => 444 }

=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}

# If they were conflicting keys (which there are), the values in h2 take precedence, 
# So basically, when you merge a hash with conflicting keys, the hash that is being merged with the original hash will overwrite the conflicting key value of the original hash being merged. 

# The opposite is true if you merge hashes the opposite way

>> h2.merge(h1)                           # h1 overwrites h2's "b" value !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=> {"b"=>222, "c"=>444, "a"=>111}

# This is a great way to merge hashes, but it does not make use of code blocks. Lets adress that now.
>> h1.merge(h2)
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}

     #-------------------
     # - MERGE with code blocks | Blocks are for conflict resolution  
     #-------------------

# The block in the case of merge, is "ONLY" going to be called when theres a conflict between two keys.

# We get the same output as we did above on our regular h1.merge(h2) merge or seen below.
>> h1.merge(h2)
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}

=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}  # You will see that it picked h1's b222 because its lower than h2's b333

# Short more efficient obfuscated example:
>> h1.merge(h2) {|key,old,new| old < new ? old : new }
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}

# Shorter more obfuscated example:
>> h1.merge(h2) {|k,o,n| o < n ? o : n }
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>444}

# Shorthand example broken down
>> h1.merge(h2) {|k,o,n|          o < n              ? o            : n }      # ternary operator notation
# from back when we studied conditionals
#              Inline notation!!, old less than new, then return o, otherwise return n 

# We are saying, when there is a conflict, pick the one that has the lower value. 
# We dont care which is newer or older, we want to keep the one with the lowest value.

# Another point about merge is that it never changed our original h1 and h2 values:
>> h1 = {"a"=>111, "b"=>222}  # Just here as a visual aid, so you dont have to scroll up to see it (im lazy)!

=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
>> h1
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>333, "c"=>444}
>> h2
=> {"b"=>333, "c"=>444}                  # h2 remains the same because we havent merge! it !!!

=begin
merge! adds the contents of h2 to h1. If no block is specified entries with duplicate keys are overwritten with the values from h2, otherwise
the value of each duplicate key is determined by calling the block with the key, its value in h1 and its value in h2. 

Tip 1: merge! means to permanently change this hash. merge!
Tip 2: We can also supply a block to merge!

Bottomline:

The block pretty much says, instead of me automatically deciding which one wins out, let me pass you those
variables and you decide, and in the end what I need you to give me back is the correct value. 
We can put something very complicated in the fourth value above 'new' or 'old', but ultimately we need to come
up with the value that will win out between the two hashes being merged.  
***The final value that we return out of the block should be whatever we want the new value to be.

Bottomline #2. What we are saying, hey merge, this is what I want you to do if you find a conflict. 
REMEMBER that block in the case or merge, is only going to be called when theres a conflict between two keys.
=end

     #-------------------
     # - COLLECT  
     #-------------------
# Next we look at the collect method, which also makes use of a code block.

# Collect has a synonym of map

# Collect/ map       # Its up to yu which one you want to use.
# You can use map to conserve space, keep it from wrapping around a line. The collect or map method works best 
# with:

# Arrays        # Used most often with arrays out of the 3

     #-------------------
     # - Collect method with Arrays
     #-------------------
>> array
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> array.collect {|i| i + 1 }     # block variable i declared within the code block
=> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]                # Iterates thru the array, taking each item & passing it up to i
                                  # Then it does whatever we tell it to do within our code block <forrest gump
                                  # Applies that processing to it, then puts that value into a new array
>> array
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>> array.collect {|i| i * 40 }    # Code blocks perform whatever processing you want done to each element (1-5)
=> [40, 80, 120, 160, 200]

=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
>> ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].map {|fruit| fruit.capitalize if fruit == 'banana'}
=> [nil, "Banana", nil]

=begin
The above did not return apple or orange. This is a very important point that can confuse tons of people
when using collect / map. the above essentialy says, (if fruit == 'banana') then it capitalizes it. 
The (fruit.capitalize) is returning the value of fruit capitalized. But if not, 
then its returning no value at all.
=end

>> ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].map do |fruit|
?>     if fruit == 'banana'                      # If fruit = banana
>>     fruit.capitalize                          # Capitalize it
>>     else                                      # If it does not
?>       fruit                                   # Return the value of fruit
>>     end                                       # end loop
>>   end                                         # end loop
=> ["apple", "Banana", "orange"]

# You have to be explicit about which values you want returned. Whatever value comes out of your processing (fruit.capitalize if fruit == 'banana'}) is whats going to be put into the
# returned array. # got it, good!!!!!

# The value of (fruit.capitalize if fruit == 'banana'}) when it iterated thru apple or orange was not = to banana so it could not capitalize and returned nil.

# Ok, that makes sense, so why didnt it just return an array with the value "Banana" only?  

     #-------------------
     # - Tip 1 to REMEMBER
     #-------------------

# You want to always keep in mind that the number of items that go into collect = number of items out !!!!!
# For example, if you have 10 items going into collect, but only have processing/logic on 4 of them, 10 items will be returned, but with 4 values, and 6 nil's. Got it, good!!!!!

     #-------------------
     # - Tip 2 to REMEMBER
     #-------------------

# Another important thing to remember about collect is that even though it works with hashes, arrays, and ranges
# IT ALWAYS returns/converts them to an array!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Range with the collect method

# Hash with the collect method
>> hash = {"a" => 111, "b" => 222, "c" => 333}
=> {"a"=>111, "b"=>222, "c"=>333}

=> ["a", "b", "c"]
>> hash.keys                        # This is the same thing as the above code block           
=> ["a", "b", "c"]

>> hash.map {|k,v| v }
=> [111, 222, 333]
>> hash.map {|k,v| v * 20}

# Display key name and value * 20!

     # - Tip 3 to REMEMBER
     #-------------------

# Remember that the output value, and return value are two different things in ruby. 
# Using puts with collect will output as expected, but it will empty out the array and its return value.
>> ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].map {|fruit| puts fruit.capitalize }
Apple                                # <-----------Output value
Banana                               # <-----------Output value
Orange                               # <-----------Output value
=> [nil, nil, nil]                   # <-----------Return value

# To confirm we have this example:
>> new_array = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].map {|fruit| puts fruit.capitalize }
Apple
Banana
Orange
=> [nil, nil, nil]
>> new_array
=> [nil, nil, nil]

# The correct way to output is to NOT use puts, and just report the value back.
>> new_array = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'].map {|fruit| fruit.capitalize }
=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]
>> new_array
=> ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"]

     #-------------------
     # - Tip 4 to REMEMBER
     #-------------------
# Collect / map have exclamation mark functions just like merge. 
# collect! & map! invoke the block once for each element of self, replacing the element with the value returned by block. It will transform the array that were working with, 
# so that the processing is applied in place & actually replaces the values instead of giving a new array

# Collect and map are really powerful ways to take an array and apply a transformation to all the 
# elements in the array. It can be very useful when doing data processing. It will take every item and 
# apply the same transformation to it. Just keep in mind the 4 pitfalls discussed as well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


     #-------------------
     # - SORT
     #-------------------

# The sort method also makes use of a code block. In the code blocks we have used in the past we have 
# put booleans, and conditional statements in our code blocks to determine whether a certain value 
# should be returned or weve returned the value thats the result of some sort of transformation or processing
# that weve done. With sort, were going to provide a comparison. 

     #-------------------
     # - Comparison Operator
     #-------------------
<=>    # spaceship operator

# We use it to compare two values:
?>   q = 1000
=> 1000
>> e = 2000
=> 2000
>> q <=> e                     # Comparing the two q + e values
=> -1                          # -1 Means its "Less Than"
>> e <=> q
=> 1                           # 1 Means its "More Than"
>> q =2000
=> 2000
>> e <=> q
=> 0                          # 0 Means their "Equal"

# As seen above, comparison operators can be similar to a boolean which returns only true or false. 
# But it is much better than a boolean because it returns -1, 0 or 1 numbers. 
-1 Less than
0  Equal
1  More Than

# The above examples are very simple and dont illustrate the use of comparison operators with sort.


     #-------------------
     # - Comparison Operators with sort
     #-------------------

# When using sort, sort uses comparison operators to decide which way the values have to go in the sort.
   
   +---------------+--------------+
   |-1 | Less than | Moves "left" |
   --------------------------------
   | 0 | Equal     | Stays        |
   --------------------------------          # 04. Code blocks sort.mov @ 01:30
   | 1 | More Than | Moves "right"|
   +---------------+--------------+

# Arrays with the sort operator
    
# Arrays are always maintained in order, thats the nature of an array, its an ordered set until we run the sort  # function thru it.
>> array
=> [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

# The code block is going to have a couple of things declared as block variables.

>> array.sort {|v1, v2| v1 <=> v2 }  # sort will send us each of these values in turn for the comparison
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# What the code block is doing, and more specifically what the v1 is doing is, yielding up the first 2 values
# 3, and 1. When those values come up to the sort block it says "when I do my comparison 3 is > than 1 so 
# 3 should move to the right, and 1 will move to the left. That will place all values closer to the correct sort otder. Ruby is not going thru each of these individually, it makes use of a
# more advanced algorithm, but this simply describes the behavior of whats happening.

# Running array.sort returns the same output.
>> array.sort                                  # sorts default behavior is to sort from least-gretest
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# So why did we use a code bock then? We used a code block so that we could add extra complexity to our dataset
# and change the behavior.

# Reverse sorting
>> array.sort {|v1, v2| v2 <=> v1 }
=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]                                                                                                                  

# Same effect
>> array.sort.reverse
=> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# Also 
>> array.reverse
=> [4, 2, 5, 1, 3]

# Heres what I mean by adding extra complexity
?>   fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange", "pear" ]
=> ["banana", "apple", "orange", "pear"]
>> fruits.sort                                     # sort places string values in alphabetical order by default
=> ["apple", "banana", "orange", "pear"]

# If we wanted to sort by the length of the string 
?>   fruits.sort {|fruit1,fruit2| fruit1.length <=> fruit2.length} # fruit1 length vs fruit2 length
=> ["pear", "apple", "banana", "orange"]

# Switch
>> fruits.sort {|fruit1,fruit2| fruit2.length <=> fruit1.length}
=> ["banana", "orange", "apple", "pear"]
>> fruits.sort {|fruit1,fruit2| fruit1.length <=> fruit2.length}.reverse
=> ["banana", "orange", "apple", "pear"]

# An faster/easier method for sorting by one property is sort_by
>> fruits.sort_by {|fruit| fruit.length}
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]

# sort_by says go to the block and get the value I should use for a comparison, the comparison is internal to sort_by (fruit.length)

# To further illustrate the point
>> fruits.sort_by {|fruit| fruit.reverse}
=> ["banana", "orange", "apple", "pear"]

# This says, go to each one, reverse the characters, & sort if based on the words backwards - forwards
# Letter for letter!!!!

     #-------------------
     # - Important note to keep in mind
     #-------------------

=begin
Theres also an exclamation point version like merge, and collect for sort!
Sorts self. Comparisons for the sort will be done using the <=> operator or using an optional code block. The block implements a comparison between a and b, returning -1, 0, or +1. See
also Enumerable#sort_by. sort! changes the values permanently!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
=end

>> fruits.sort! {|fruit1,fruit2| fruit1.length <=> fruit2.length} # sort! changes the values permanently!!
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]
>> fruits
=> ["pear", "apple", "orange", "banana"]                 


# The last thing I want to show you
# Typically arrays are what we would sort, but we can also sort hashes
# Ruby turns a hash into an array in order to sort it. 
>> hash
=> {"c"=>222, "a"=>555, "d"=>111, "b"=>333}
>> hash.to_a                                           # hash to array
=> [["c", 222], ["a", 555], ["d", 111], ["b", 333]]

# Changes it to an array, its no longer an array, this is very important !!

>> hash.to_a.sort                                      # hash to array then sort it
=> [["a", 555], ["b", 333], ["c", 222], ["d", 111]]

# Now when we talk to the code block, the first one will be item "a" compared with item "b"!!! 
# If we just compare the items themselves, unless the keys and values are the same, which 
# is not possible in a hash because the key cant be the same because they would replace eachother!!

# The following array's have only two elements, they have keys, and values because they were converted from 
# a hash to an array.

# Sorts according to their keys a,b,c,d
>> hash.sort {|item1,item2| item1[0] <=> item2[0] }   # look inside item1="a" @ index0, item2="b" @ index0, 
=> [["a", 555], ["b", 333], ["c", 222], ["d", 111]]   # We *HAVE to input the index # because we are dealing
                                                      # with arrays positioning, and getting information from them
# Sorts according to their values
>> hash.sort {|item1,item2| item1[1] <=> item2[1] }
=> [["d", 111], ["c", 222], ["b", 333], ["a", 555]]

# In the coce block, you cant talk to it like a hash anymore, it doesnt have it key/value pair.
# Now they are to be addressed as arrays!!!!


     #-------------------
     # - INJECT
     #-------------------

=begin
Inject is another ruby method that makes good use of code blocks. Inject is an acumulator.
When you see inject, immediately think accumulate!!! If were gonna accumulate values, were gonna need somewhere to accumulate them to right, so were gonna need variables. 

Well have a block variable that'll do our accumulating for us. By convention, that block variable is called memo

Its helpful before going into inject, to quickly go back and look at collect for a second.
=end

>> (1..10).collect{|n| n * 20 }
=> [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200]

# A 1-10 range using the collect method with a block, & it would apply that block as a transformation
# to each one of the elements. 

# With inject were going to be doing the same kind of thing, but were going to be taking that value,  
# and accumulating it eachtime and were going to be storing it in memo or // block variable (;
# so thats the difference between inject and collect. So know we can look at inject

     #-------------------
     # - INJECT / Lets try this again {;
     #-------------------

>>   (1..10).inject {|memo, n | memo + n }
=> 55

# 1-10, were using the inject method followed by a code block, & memo is declared as being the accumulator
# and the n variable is where eachone of the elements will be yielded up so that we can use it in our block,
# just how we did with collect. So know our block needs to tell it how it should do the accumulation, 
# and the end result of whatever we put in there, its whats going to be stored in memo. SO if we just put the 
# number 1 there, then it doesnt matter how many elements at the end, memo is = to 1. Because eachtime
# it looped thru, we just said 1, 1, 1, 1 ..etc. 

# this example just shows a simple sum of all the numbers, so eachtime its gonna go thru, its gonna
# take whatever value it had previously and add the next number to it and then store that in memo, 
# take the next value and so on.. 

     #-------------------
     # - Here is a visual example
     #-------------------


memo = 1                       # memo is = to 1, becase it takes the first value as it initialization value
memo = memo + 2                # next is memo = memo + 2 which is 3 store it in memo, ....  so on and so forth
memo = memo + 3
memo = memo + 4
memo = memo + 5
memo = memo + 6
memo = memo + 7
memo = memo + 8
memo = memo + 9
memo = memo + 10


     #-------------------
     # - Quick array of 1-10 with the splat operator
     #-------------------

>> array = [*1..10]                 
=> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

>> sum = array.inject {|memo, n| memo + n } # storing the resulting value in memo automatically
=> 55                                       
# memo + n tells it to use its old value memo, the results of this will be stored in the new memo value 
# that will be passed to the next loop. 

# Sure enough if you add up all the numbers you end up with 55. // 06 Methods // Inject.mov 03:20

# The first time thru, memo gets set to 1 automatically. The block doesnt get applied the first time until 
# it gets to 2. That is the default behavior if we dont set 1 to another value.

     #-------------------
     # - Set a value other than 1
     #-------------------

>> sum = array.inject(100) {|memo, n| memo + n} # starting/initialization value is provided in ()'s
=> 155

# So now the first time thru, memo will be = to 100 and the first number it adds to it will be 1 on the first
# iteration. Before, when we provided no starting/initialization value above its first iteration was started at 2.  

# We are not limited to just addition otherwise we would just call it sum. 04:14

     #-------------------
     # - Multiply
     #-------------------

>> product = array.inject {|memo, n| memo * n}                 # give us the product of 1..10 *'d together
=> 3628800

# We could also give it a starting value of 2, now it will be that same number * 2. It starts out with a value
# of 2, then it does all its multiplication. 
>> product = array.inject(2) {|memo, n| memo * n}
=> 7257600


     #-------------------
     # - Important note
     #-------------------

# Just how when we were working with the collect method. We want to be careful of the value that gets returned 
# here. You want to make sure that its always really the value that you want to store in memo. So, whatever
# comes out of this, the resulting return value is what you want.

 >> sum = array.inject {|memo, n| memo + n if n != 3}  # + n if n is not = to 3
: undefined method + for nil:NilClass
        from (irb):448:in block in irb_binding
        from (irb):448:in each
        from (irb):448:in inject
	
# The error is saying that it tried to use + when we had a nil value. You cant add something to nil.
# What happened is that it looped thru, and when it got to the 3, it said, ooh, n IS = to 3 so im not 
# going to run "memo + n" at all. So none of this statement is taking place "memo + n if n != 3", and 
# the resulting value is nil and nil is what gets stored in memo.
	
# So thats the end rseult, it puts nil aside, and the next loop it tries to add nil to every element in the sequence.
	
# SO just be careful that the return value is indeed the one you wish to store at the end of that iteration.
	
     #-------------------
     # - Another example that ususally confuses people when working with inject
     #-------------------
	
# This is similar to when we covered the collect method.
>> sum = array.inject {|memo, n| puts memo + n}          # add output inside code block
3
NoMethodError: undefined method + for nil:NilClass
        from (irb):449:in block in irb_binding
        from (irb):449:in each
        from (irb):449:in inject

# We get the same kind of error because the return value of "puts memo + n" is nil, same rules for nil 
# apply here

     #-------------------
     # - Important note
     #-------------------
	
# Nil is not the same as zero. 
	
	
# One way to workaround the error, if you really want to "puts memo + n" its
# probably better to use an each method and use it that way. But if were realy tring to accumulate we can simply
# apply the final value to memo for example. 
	
>> sum = array.inject {|memo, n| puts memo + n; memo}    # the semicolon lets use put it all on the same line
3                                                        # thats the one time we CAN use semicolins in ruby

=> 1
	
# Now it does output results everytime without giving us an error. But what its actually doing is setting memo to 1 everytime because it started out as one.  So it puts 1 + 2 which is 3,
# then it says your return value is one, so it sets memo = 1. The overall point is just to be aware that 
# the result pf all of this "puts memo + n; memo" is whats going to be stored in memo for the next iteration.
# 

     #-------------------
     # - More exotic example to help solidify the concept 
     #-------------------

>> fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'plum'] 
=> ["apple", "pear", "banana", "plum"]

# Right off the bat you might think that you cant use inject with an array thats made up with strings like this
# We actually can, all were doing is storing values for the next round. Thats all it is, were storing a value, 
# and each time we go thru that well then use in the future.

>> longest_word = fruits.inject do |memo, fruit|

     '#5 METHODS'  
#--------------------------------------

     #-------------------
     # - what is a method? 
     #-------------------
     
# Methods are what allows us to play with our data, as an example:
>> "Hello".reverse.capitalize
=> "Olleh"

# The above are called object methods or standalone methods. We will discuss class methods in the next section.

# Creating a method is easy,

def method_man                               # Def is short for define
  puts "Member of the WU-TANG KILLA BEES"
end

# Now, when anybody does a method call to method_man, they will execute the code in the code block 
>> method_man
Member of the WU-TANG KILLA BEES
=> nil
>>

# The reason methods are so useful is because we can create our own methods, and place complex code inside them and call all of that complexity with a simple method call.


     #-------------------
     # - Important Tip 
     #-------------------

# Methods can have question marks at the end like:
def over_five?                                      # Run a test or return a boolean testcase
  value = 3
  puts value > 5 ? 'Over 5' : 'Not over 5'


     #-------------------
     # - Important Tip 
     #-------------------

# Methods must be defined before calling them, obviously huh :)
  

  
     #-------------------
     # - Variable scope in methods 
     #-------------------

# Method names and local variables look the same so make sure you name them clearly to distinguish.  
  
  
     #-------------------
     # - Arguments 
     #-------------------
  
# Comma separated list of values that are passed into methods
# The values are passed in when they are called. We dont have to worry if they all have been set. 
# In order for args to work, we need a local variable to catch the values as theyre passed in to the method.
# With arguments, you dont have to worry about variable scope in methods.
# Arguments give the real power and flexability to ruby methods. 
  
# Methods with arguments typically use ()'s
# Methods without arguments typically do not
# Parenthesis are optional in both cases
def welcome(name)
	puts "Hello #{name}!"
end

def add(n1, n2)
	puts n1 + n2
end

def longest_word(words)
  longest_word = words.inject do |memo,word|

     '#6 CLASSES'  
#--------------------------------------

     #-------------------
     # - Defining and using Classes and creating objects
     #-------------------
     
=begin     
Classes are the backbone of object oriented programming. They define objects, what an object is, and they 
define what an object can do. Weve been working with pre-defined ruby objects in the past. Now we are getting into programming our own classes, that will define our own objects. 
     
Defining a class is simple:     
=end
     
class NmapScannerModule
  xyz
end

     #-------------------
     # - Naming convention | Methods vs. Classes 
     #-------------------

# One huge difference between classes and method naming structure, is that methods take lower_case separated by # underscores, and classes take CamelCase, where it begins with a capitol
# letter, and every other first letter in a word capitalized
     
     #-------------------
     # - Benefits of using Classes 
     #-------------------

# Classes will:
# * Group the code into discreet, well-categorized areas
# * Make the code easier to work with
# * Allow complex behaviors using very simple statements
# * Our objects all correspond to real world objects
# * Wrap custom methods inside our classes

     #-------------------
     # - Create a Class with a method in it

     # - Class Instances 
     #-------------------

# Instances are a fundamental concept of OO programming, and essential when working with classes.

# An instance is also an ocurrence of our class or:
	An object created from a class

# For example:
>> class Animal
>>   def make_noise
>>     "Moo!"
>>     end
>>   end
=> nil
>> Animal.new                     # <-- We created an instance of the class Animal
=> #<Animal:0x0000000090ec50>
>> animal = Animal.new            # <-- And then we assigned it to a variable
=> #<Animal:0x00000000ddce80>
>> animal
=> #<Animal:0x00000000ddce80>
	
# Second example:
class Animal
  def make_noise
    "Moo!"
  end
end

animal1 = Animal.new              # <-- Instance of Animal class with "Animal.new"
puts animal1.make_noise            # <-- And then we assigned it to the animal variable

     # - Important note 
     #-------------------

=begin
Both of these instances are going to do, and return the same thing. But the importnt thing 
about instances is that they are not the same. They are two separate objects!!!

EVERY time we call "Animal.new" we get back a new, and different instance/object. 
Its a lot like the memo pads, where you pull off a seperate page for every new message. Each message/page is different, but they all came from the same place. The memo pad is like the
class, it has all the definitions for it, it has all those blank spaces filled in, it pre-defines
how you can take a message, but each and every time we pull it off, we make a new instance of it, 
and we fill it out differently with different information with each call.

So how do we fill out the blanks on these forms, how do we tell our animals apart, so that 
different animals make different noises, different names, different numbers of legs... etc

In order to do that we :
 * Put variables inside of our class definitions to hold those attributes
 
=end


     #-------------------
     # - Class Attributes 
     #-------------------

=begin
Attributes are how we can differentiate between instances. For example, if we have a class listing different vulnerabilities, we have to have some way to differentiate between them all.
Thats where attributes all come into play. 

Going back to the previous memo pad example:

The attributes are the blanks on the forms that were going to fill out with different values.

What were really talking about when dealing with attributes are:

Attribute:
A value that persists inside of an instance, and for that were going to need a variable.
A variable that can store those values, and can keep them around inside the instance.

Ruby has a variable made especially for this purpose:
=end

Global    $variable
Class     @@variable
Instance  @variable
Local     variable
Block     variable

# Instance variables are used to store the attributes inside of our instances.


     #-------------------
     # - Adding a noise attribute to our Animal class 
     #-------------------

class Animal
  def make_noise
    @noise                        # Calling an attribute is as easy calling for the variable value
                                  # The ? is how do we set the variable, so we can call/return it
  end
end

animal1 = Animal.new              # <-- Instance of Animal class with "Animal.new"
animal1.noise = "Moo!"
puts animal1.make_noise            # <-- And then we assigned it to the animal variable

animal2 = Animal.new              # <-- 2nd instance of Animal class with "Animal.new"
puts animal2.make_noise            # Tell Animal2 to make noise

# This error indicates a very important point about ruby that states: 
# You NEVER have access to instance variables from outside of the instance. They are locked away inside of the instance, where we cant set nor retrieve them! 

# Now wait a minute your thinking, we cant retrieve it, thats exactly what were doing when we say,
# make_noise. Well thats because we CAN access the methods that are inside the class, and the methods 
# have access to the instance variable. The scope of an instance variable is inside all of the 
# methods of the instance but not outside the instance. So if we want to get to those values of the 
# instance variable, we have to use methods.

    # - Reader/Writer Methods to make the process easier and shorter with syntactic sugar !!!!!
    #-------------------

# In our previous tutorial, we showed how we can access our instance variables using methods.
# We will explore those ideas a bit further by exploring reader, and writer methods.

# Weve seen how we can use reader/writer methods in order to access our attributes.

# Well, what if I have a huge-complex class with tons of atttributes,
# do I have to go in there and write a reader/writer method for each of them????

# No you dont:


    #-------------------
    # - Attribute Methods 
    #-------------------

# This is done so often that you can simply use an attribute method.

attr_* methods    # They always start with attr

# We will look at the following methods:

attr_reader                  # creates a reader/GET method
attr_writer                  # creates a writer/SET method
attr_accessor                # creates both a reader/writer/SET/GET method

# Each method above is put into our class and when its called, it takes a symbol that we provide after
# and it turns it into a method for us that we can then use. So its exactly the same thing as if we 
# typed it out the long way. 

# attr_writer creates:
attr_writer :name
def name=(value)
 @name = value
end


# When we need to read/write. we should use
attr_accessor :name

def name
  @name
end

def name=(value)
  @name = value
end

# It literally creates two methods for us, and SAVES us a whole mess of typing:
   def noise=(noise)              # Set a set instance that will set it for us (SET METHOD)
     @noise = noise               # This does not allow the flexability that we want, but it will soon
   end
     
  def noise                       # Set a get instance that will set it for us (GET METHOD)
    @noise                        # Calling an attribute is as easy calling for the variable value
  end                             # The ? is how do we set the variable, so we can call/return it
end


# But what if I want to create more than 1:
# Simply use a comma and add as many as you wish.

    #-------------------
    # - Class Methods 
    #-------------------

# So far we have created instances of our classes (instance methods), and weve been calling methods 
# on that instance. But we can also call methods directly on the class itself.
# Those are called Class Methods.

# Class method = A method that can be called on a class, even without an instance of the class.

Animal.new # .new is a builtin class method for every ruby object
           # So when we call .new it returns a new instance to us
           # But its still a method, its a method that exists on the class even when we dont have an
           # instance. Ans that is what were going to use class methods for.

# Were going to use class methods when we want the class to do something for us, even when there is no 
# instance in sight. It doesnt matter, maybe there are instances, maybe there arent, 
# it doesnt really matter!

    #-------------------
    # - Defining Class Methods 
    #-------------------

# Its very easy to define a class method, its the same way as instance methods, except we put the self
# keyword in front.

def self.method_name   # "self.method_name" lets us know that its a class method
  xyz                  # It is something that our class itself will execute!
end                    


    #-------------------
    # - Important tip 
    #-------------------

# The self keyword in ruby applies to whatever object were currently in.So in the above case, where were in the definition of the class, self is the class itself!!!

    #-------------------
    # - 4 Important points to make a note of !!!
    #-------------------

1. We didnt have an instance when we called Animal.all_species.inspect !
2. We called it directly on the class !
3. The kind of information we returned was general info about the class itself !
4. As noted earlier, .new is an example of a class method. We can create our own class methods, 
   that do things for us instead of just returning information !

# In this tutorial, were looking at class attributes that store values that are particular to 
# our classes. 

# Class attributes = Store values that apply to the class generally
# The same way that the class methods apply to the class generally

     '#7 MODULES'  
#--------------------------------------

     #-------------------
     # - What is a module ? 
     #-------------------
 
# Modules are wrappers around our ruby code. You might be thinking that classes are the same as modules,
# A class is a way for us to roll up different methods, and attributes into a wrapper.

# Modules work in a very similar way, with one important difference.
# They cant be instantiated, meaning we can never have an instance of a module, 
# the way we have an instance of a class. Instead were going to use our modules in conjunction with 
# our classes. That makes more sense as we examine the two reasons why we would want to use modules.
     
     #-------------------
     # - Namespacing 
     #-------------------

* Namespacing allows us to have class names that dont conflict.

# Namespacing can:
* Keep class names distinct from standard Ruby classes
* Disambiguate your own class definitions
* Ensure classes used in open sourced code wont conflict
     
=begin

Example:

If your developing an online dating site, and you have to write a class that sets up the actual date between two people. Our definition of date is totally different from the standard ruby
definition of a date, which is a calendar date with a year, month, and a day.

=end
     
     class Date
       xyz
     end
     
     dinner = Date.new           # Meeting that should happen
     dinner.date = Date.new      # Calendar date that event will take place on

=begin
So Ruby will get confused because by the same names because it cant tell the difference between our date as in meeting up with someone, and the calendar date mentoned above.

=end

# You can obviously see the conflict above. This is where namespacing helps us.
# All we have to do is wrap our class in a module name to avoid name conflict.
     
     module Romantic
       class Date
	 xyz
       end
     end
     
     dinner = Romantic::Date.new   # Actual meeting of the two people  // namespaced / wrapped date !!
     dinner.date = Date.new        # Calendar details of the event taking place
     

     #-------------------
     # - Mix-Ins 
     #-------------------
     
# What are Mix-Ins?
# In the previous lesson we learned about modules for namespacing. IN this lesson, well look at
# the second most powerful way to use modules, which is to use them as mixins.
    
# In ruby we are only allowed to inherit from one Parent or SuperClass. If assitional functionality is needed, it can be placed into a module and mixed in to any class that needs it. 
     
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

module ContactInfo    # This will not wrap around our class, its a standalone module
    attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :city, :state, :zip_code

 def full_name        # We want the full_name method in all three classes. 
                      # We could copy it and use it that way, but if it was a large complex method, that
                      # would be a really bad thing to do. SO what we really want to do it use modules,
                      # as mixins for this behavior, as seen above!
   
   return @first_name + " " + @last_name
 end

 def city_state_zip
    csz = @city
    csz += ", #{@state}" if @state
    csz += " #{zip_code}" if @zip_code
    return csz
  end

end                    # Modules are just wrappers for code

class Person
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

class Teacher
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

class Student < Person # Student class inherited from the Person class which has the ContactInfo module
  attr_accessor :book, :grades  # It also added some of its own custom attributes to the mix
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited
     

     #-------------------
     # - Load, require and include 
     #-------------------

# In the last lesson we learned how to use modules as mixins. We defined our module and our classes all 
# in the same file. Making sure that the module came before the class, at the very top. To ensure that ruby would have a definition for the module, so that it could include it when 
# the class definition came up.  


     #-------------------
     # - Important Note 
     #-------------------

# * Modules are usually kept in seperate files
# * Module files can server as code libraries & we simply mixin that library whenever we need it
# * We need to have a way to load modules so that ruby already has the definition
# before we try and mix it in with one of our classes in our ruby programs

# We can use the following commmands for such actions:

load    # used to load module files to be used by our classes // sort of like a pre-requisite
include # used exclusively for bringing modules in as mixins, it has nothing to do with loading in files

# Require example:

load 'contact.rb'
class Person
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

load 'contact.rb'
class Teacher
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

load 'contact.rb'
class Student < Person # Student class inherited from the Person class which has the ContactInfo module
  attr_accessor :book, :grades  # It also added some of its own custom attributes to the mix
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

# We dont want to load load 'contact.rb' 3 times in the above class file. 
# That is a waste of time and resources. A better way i to use require!!

     #-------------------
     # - require 
     #-------------------

require 'contact.rb'   # Keeps track if the file has already been loaded,
                       # & only includes it if it has not been loaded before.
class Person
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

class Teacher
  include ContactInfo  # Will include ContactInfo module and all of its functionality
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited

class Student < Person # Student class inherited from the Person class which has the ContactInfo module
  attr_accessor :book, :grades  # It also added some of its own custom attributes to the mix
end                    # Module functionality is also inherited


     #-------------------
     # - RECAP !!! 
     #-------------------

load    # loads source file every time its called, will return true if the file has already been loaded
require # loads a source file only once, and will not reload if already added!
include # includes modules, has nothing to do with files


     #-------------------
     # - Enumerable as a Mix-In 07. Classes 04. 02:03 | A bit Advanced!!!
     #-------------------

# Quick insight in how ruby uses modules inside its standard library of classes.

# An enumerable is something that can be counted. If we have a set of things that can be counted,
# then we should be able to do something with them (sort them, collect them, search thru them). 
# and that functonality is mixed in to all of those ruby sets, (array, range, hash, string)
# You can start to see how ruby shares all of this functionality between the different classes.


#--------------------------------------
     '#8 WORKING WITH FLAT FILES'  
#--------------------------------------

     #-------------------
     # - File path separators 
     #-------------------
  
# Windows has c:\ or "\"
# UNIX/Linux has /home or "/"
     
# So the question is, which of these do we use in our ruby code if we want our application to be cross platform?
     
# I ruby you should always use the forward slash notation and it will work on both UNIX/Windows.
# But you dont want to use back slash because it wont work on UNIX/LINUX.
     
# But theres an even better way of doing it. Its by using the file class, the file class 
# has a method called join, and all it does it take a bunch of strings and join them together with the apropriate separator
     
     File.join('shared', 'lib', 'myfile.rb')
     
     # So on UNIX well get /, and on Windows well get \

     #-------------------
     # - File paths 
     #-------------------

# Now that we know how we can use ruby to get the right file path separators, 
# We need to understand how we can get meaningful file paths. How we can locate the files that we either
# want to write to, or read from. 
     
Absolute path: /etc/shadow                     # Path from the beginning of the UNIX root directory
               C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM  # Path from the beginning of the Windows root directory
	       
Relative Path: ./../../path/to/file            # single dot is current directory, 
                                               # double dot is moving back one directory

# If were going to use a variable path we need to know in which directory we are in when executing
# our program. sort of like $PWD. 

# The ruby variable that allows us to do that is 

__FILE__                   # Will just return the name of the file to us
File.expand_path(__FILE__) # Use a method on the file class for it to tell us where exactly the file is
                           # That says tell me what the absolute path to this file is!!

# To ensure success within cross platform systems, using a relative path, then getting an absolute path
# from that is much better, than the other way around. 

# Relative paths

# __FILE__ is this file
puts __FILE__

# Expand_path will convert a relative path to an absolute path. In this case, it returns the full
# path to the file
puts File.expand_path(__FILE__)

# Relative paths are easiest when you start with this directory
puts File.dirname(__FILE__)

     #-------------------
     # - Important Note 
     #-------------------

# If you have a file with a space in the name, you have to escape the space with a backslash,
# and put it in double quotes.
puts File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', "Excercise\ Files")


     #-------------------
     # - Accessing Files 
     #-------------------

# File.new takes two arguments from the file we want to read from or write to
>> file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'w')     # 1st argv is filename, 2 is write mode
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>
>> file.close                                   # 2 reasons to close it properly
                                                # to prevent unintentional file writes
                                                # to free-up ruby resources holding the file open

# File.open
File.open('file1.txt', 'r') do |file|
    # read data from the file
end

# This method works in very much the same way as File.new but instead of instantiating a file object,
# we just open a file & pass it a code block of instructions. In the end, it closes it for us.
# You should always use File.open instead of File.new because it closes it for you, and you dont have to worry about the two reasons we previously discussed above.

# second argv is the mode: 
r    # read from the start, file must already exist
r+   # read and write "WITHOUT" destructing or wiping out the existing document / file !!!
w    # writes from the start, if file exists it wipes it, if it doesnt, it creates it (destructive)
w+   # read & write from the start of the doc "WITH" destructive truncating // quick way to wipe a file!
a    # append to the end of a file, a log file for example
a+   # read and write to the end of the document.

# The modes you should use are:
    
r   # Useful when you want to read from a file
w   # Useful when you want to start a brand new document
a   # Special case for when you want to append something to the end of a file
r+  # Useful when you want to read/write to/from a file

    
     #-------------------
     # - Writing to files 
     #-------------------
   
# Write data to a file using puts as an instance method
>> file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'w')
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>
>> file.puts "abcd"                      # Using this method, ruby waits for us to close the file before
=> nill                                  # writing the data
?>   file.close
?>   file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'w')
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>
>> file.puts "abcd"
=> nil
>> file.print "efgh"                    # Same as puts but doesnt place a line return \n like puts does
>> file.write "ijkl"
=> 4                                    # Do the same as print & returns the # of chars/bytes it wrote 
>> file << "mnop"                       # Append to the file with the append method <<
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>             # It returns the file object to us


     #-------------------
     # - Reading from files 
     #-------------------

>> file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'r')   # Notice the 'r' instead of 'w', 'w' would wipe the file
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>
>> file.gets                                  # We used puts to enter data to file
=> "abcd\n"                                   # So we can also use gets to retrieve data from the file


     #-------------------
     # - Important Note !!!
     #-------------------

file.gets is the exact mirror of file.puts.
file.puts adds a line, plus a line return, and file.gets retrieves the line, plus the line return !!!


# FILE.GETS.CHOMP EXAMPLE:
>> file.gets.chomp
=> "efghijklmnop"                                  # Gets the next line without the line return

# Lets try running file.gets.chomp one more time
>> file.gets.chomp
NoMethodError: undefined method chomp for nil:NilClass
        from (irb):519
        from /usr/bin/irb:12:in <main>

     #-------------------
     # - Important Note !!!
     #-------------------

	# It errored out because there was no other data in the file to get because we reached the end of the file.

	
>> file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'r')
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>	

# Instead of reading a full line, we can also read part of a line
>> file.read(4)                       # Read four chars/bytes from the file
=> "abcd"      
>> file.read(3)                       # Read three chars/bytes from the file
=> "\nef"                             # Line return counts as a character \n
>> file.read(3)
=> "ghi"

# Those are the two primary ways of reading from a file. We can get back the entire line,
# or we can just retrieve a specific # of chars/bytes from the file.

# Now this works for simple small files, but for a massive complex file this will not be as effective.
# For that, we need to loop thru the text file:
 
File.open('file1.txt', 'r') do |file|
  while line = file.gets              # While theres a new line, if it returns nil, the loop exits
      puts "** " + line.chomp.reverse + " **" # if the file exists, chomp off the end, reverse & place
  end                                         # inside these asterisks
end

# Now if you know you need to loop thru each line, the easiest way to do it is with:
File.open('file1.txt', 'r') do |file|   # Open up the file
  file.each_line {|line| puts line.upcase}  # GO thru each line, & assign it to the code block variable
end                                          # In this case were just upcasing it.



     #-------------------
     # - File Pointer
     #-------------------

# This lesson shows and explains what the file pointer is and how we can mnipulate it.
# It works just like the cursor does in your favorite word processing program.

# Two big differences:

# The tiny difference between the ruby file pointer & your favorite word processor is that if the 
# file pointer is at a specific spot, it doesnt insert text, it overwrites it. 

# Second difference is that the file pointer is not just for writing to files, but from reading 
# from files as well.

# Here well see how to find out the location of the file pointer and how to move it to different
# locations
>> file = File.new('irb_testfile.txt', 'r+')  # Note the 'r+' for non-destructive read/writing
=> #<File:irb_testfile.txt>
>> file.pos                                   # Find the location of the file pointer with .pos method
=> 0                                          # Like an array it starts counting at 0
>> file.read(3)                               # Move the file pointer up 3 spaces by reading 3 bytes
=> "abc"
>> file.pos                                  # Check pointer position again
=> 3                                         # It indeed is at position 3 ;)
>> file.gets                                 # Returns two bytes "d" & a line return
=> "d\n"
>> file.pos                                  # Pointer is at position 5
=> 5


     #----- --------------
     # - Important Note !!
     #-------------------

# The file pointer does not honor the line return returned above. You are probably asking yourself it should be at position 0, due to the new line that was returned above. Thats the
# important thing to note above the file pointer, it doesnt care about line returns, it treats every
# character in the file as one long series of numbers. Get it, got it, good !!!

# Move the file pointer to a specific position
>> file.pos = 13           # Move to position 13
=> 13
>> file.read(3)            # Read 3 bytes
=> "mno"
>> file.pos                # Current position is at 16 because it advanced when we did the previous 
=> 16                      # file.read(3)
>> file.read(10)
=> "p"
>> file.pos
=> 17
>> file.eof?              # Confirm we are at the end of the file !!!
=> true                   # If we werent at the end of the file it would return false ofcourse (;
>> file.write 'qrst'      # Append 4 bytes to the file
=> 4

     #-------------------
     # - Important Pitfalls you need to know !! | 07 File Pointer.mov 04:25
     #-------------------

# 1ST PITFALL!!

>> file.lineno            # Appears to be returning the line number right?
=> 1                      # Wrong! Its an internal counter that gets & readline uses.
                          # They use it to keep track what line they are on at the time.
                          # It has no relation WHAT-SO-EVER to the file pointer!!

# So what is file.lineno useful for? Its useful if your using gets all the time to see what line 
# you are on. 


# 2ND PITFALL!!

     #-------------------
     # - Octal notation for Nil // 07 File Pointer.mov 06:23
     #-------------------

# You CAN set the file pointer position number beyond the end of the file (Which is bad!!!). 


     #-------------------
     # - Renaming & Deleting Files 
     #-------------------

>> file = File.new('file_to_rename.txt', 'w')
=> #<File:file_to_rename.txt>
>> file.puts "This is a file for renaming and then deleting."
=> nil
>> file.close

=> 0
>> File.delete('file_to_delete.txt')                            # Delete
=> 1
>> file = File.new('file_to_copy.txt', 'w')                     # Create an initialized ver of file
=> #<File:file_to_copy.txt>
>> file.close                                                   # Close the file to create the file
=> nil

    #-------------------
    # - Important Note 
    #-------------------

# The file class gives us:
- rename
- delete, unlink is a synonym for delete, so use it as a replacement for delete if you wish


     #-------------------
     # - Important Note 
     #-------------------

# Directory/file permissions come into play when performing rename/delete operations on files/dirs
#  


     #-------------------
     # - Copying Files 
     #-------------------

>> FileUtils.copy('file_to_copy.txt', 'copied.txt')            # Both FileUtils.copy work!
=> nil 
>> FileUtils.cp('file_to_copy.txt', 'copied.txt')              # Both FileUtils.cp work!
=> nil 


    #-------------------
    # - Important Note on FileUtils 
    #-------------------

# FileUtils class that can be loaded from the ruby standard library.
require 'fileutils'

# Which gives us:
cp, copy
mv, move
rm, remove
cd, chmod, chown, pwd, ln, touch, mkdir, rmdir

# Gives us familiar unix/linux file utilities !!!!!


    #-------------------
    # - Important Note on FTools 
    #-------------------

# A module that adds FileUtils features to File, especially copy / cp
# IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE FTOOLS, use FileUtils instead because:
# its going to be removed from the Ruby Standard Library in Ruby 1.9

require 'ftools'


    #-------------------
    # - Examining File Details 
    #-------------------

# We can use the following string eachtime vs writing it all out each time by calling the file variable!
>> file = File.new('irb_test_file.txt', 'w')
=> #<File:irb_test_file.txt>

# There are a number of class methods on the file class that let us check out information.
>> File.exist?(file)
=> true                   # Useful if you want to check if a file exists before you read, write/delete

>> File.file?(file)
=> true                   # Check to see if the file is actually a file
>> File.directory?(file)
=> false                  # Check to see if its a directory


    #-------------------
    # - Important Note on file / directory 
    #-------------------

# A directory will return true that it exists, but then we can tell the difference between if its a 
# file or not by using file or directory, as shown above.


# Check for RWX FILE PERMISSIONS !!!!!!
?>   File.readable?(file)
=> true
>> File.writable?(file)

                       # like Ruby. Its especially useful to VERIFY THAT WE DONT WRITE BEYOND THE END
                       # OF THE FILE (...EOF

>> File.dirname(file)      # Show the directory of the file.
=> "."                     # Shows the dir we are currently in, as in ./test.rb (current-directory)
>> File.expand_path(file)  # Shows the full path to the file.
=> "/home/nanob0t/irb_test_file.txt"
>> File.basename(file)     # Basename just says "give me whats at the end"
=> "irb_test_file.txt"
>> full_path = File.expand_path(file)

>> File.extname(file)
=> ".txt"                     # Gives us back the file extension mname

    #-------------------
    # - Detailed File attributes | time stamps 
    #-------------------

# Class methods from the File Class:

>> File.atime(file)               # Last accessed time | read from or written to
=> 2013-02-19 22:21:25 -0800
>> File.mtime(file)               # Last modified time | written to
=> 2013-02-19 22:21:25 -0800
>> File.ctime(file)               # Last status change time, NOT created time!!!
=> 2013-02-19 22:21:25 -0800      # Read or write & changes to owner, group & permissions

# In general, try not ti use it. Only for when you need to find out :
# Read or write & changes to owner, group & permissions


    #-------------------
    # - Working on a file !!! 
    #-------------------

>>myfile = File.new(file, 'r')

                                    # It gives the starting point relative to that file.

# Directory class and its methods:
>> Dir.pwd
=> "/home/nanob0t"


    #-------------------
    # - Which do I use? 
    #-------------------

# Use __FILE__ because its relative to the .rb script, and also pwd can change


    #-------------------
    # - Move around the filesystem 
    #-------------------

# You can also navigate around the filesystem with the Directory Class methods::
>> Dir.chdir('..')                 # Move up one dir  
=> 0
>> Dir.pwd                         # Confirm
=> "/home"                         

>> Dir.chdir # This method also takes an absolute path as well as a relative path:
>> Dir.chdir(File.join('', 'home', 'nanob0t'))  # Blank separators at the beginning say start at /
=> 0
>> Dir.pwd
=> "/home/nanob0t"


    #-------------------
    # - Inspect and work with directory contents
    #-------------------

# To inspect directory contents we can use the entries Class method in the Directory Class:
>> Dir.entries('.')
